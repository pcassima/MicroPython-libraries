"""
File that contains the modules required for using 595 shift registers with the
Pycom modules.
There will be a class for the entire shift register and then a subclass for
each pin in the register. This way the the entire shift register can be used
as a true output expander. Each bit or output will then be able to used as a
"stand alone" pin. The classes and methods will then take care of write out
the correct data to the shift register.

    Class for controlling 595 shift registers from the 74-series logic IC's.
    The class supports multiple shift registers in series. If more physical
    shift registers are present than declared in code. These extra registers
    will remain blank, as the contents of the shift registers gets cleared
    before each write operation.
    The class supports write operations of the entire shift registers, single
    bytes and individual bits.
    The former two operation are the same when only one shift register is
    connected. But when multiple shift registers have been connected, you can
    write to the entire group and write to all shift registers or you can write
    to a single shift register in the group.
